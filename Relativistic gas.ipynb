    "Several of astrophysical systems can be described with the help of hydrodynamics and general relativy. Due to the complexity of these systems, there are only a few analytical solutions for them, and that explains why is necessary to use numerical methods. For example, to determine the dynamics of a gas nearby a black hole is necessary to recover the generic hydrodynamic quantities given by the next system of equations:\n",

    "the next expression provides the evolution of the total relativistic energy density measured by an eulerian observer \n",
